                    <p><b><?php echo date("M d, Y");?></b> - This morning, with the moon-Pluto square, we’ll likely feel a bit more raw than usual. You can expect periods of intense, compulsive acting out by you or those around you. If you’ve been experiencing a sense of peace and balance lately, these dramatic emotions and behaviors won’t have nearly as much effect on you than on those who have been feeling unnerved. Best to avoid any conflicts with family, friends, partners, or colleagues today because the reactions could be volatile. Things ought to become a bit more grounded and stable once the moon moves into Taurus around midday.</p>
                    <p>In the early evening, Mars conjoins Uranus, which means you might be feeling a bit trapped in your life and regretting your choices. This is likely just the transit, so don’t act too hastily!</p>
